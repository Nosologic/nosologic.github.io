subtitle: What Nosologic is all about
---

Nosologic is a foundation based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. It focuses on Evolutionary Health Geography, a term we coined ourselves. Here's what we mean by it: 

- We investigate states of health and disease 
- We look at the spatial distribution of these states at different levels of scale.
- We want to understand the causes of these distributions.
- Some of these causes lie in the distant past: these we call ultimate causes.
- In order to find them, we have to study the historical ecologies of past populations.
- Knowing these ultimate causes helps explain a patient's susceptibility to factors in their environment.   
- This helps us predict the risk of developing certain pathologies.
