More than half of all cases of hereditary deafness are due to mutations in the GJB2 gene.  Hundreds of such mutations circulate worldwide, but none of them reaches a local frequency as high as the one that predominates in the Sakha, native to Yakutia in northeastern Russia. Some 10 % of Sahka carry a copy of it, causing their hearing to deteriorate more quickly than in most people. People inheriting two copies are deaf from birth. In the Sakha, this concerns more than 1% of the population, a figure more than 5 times as high as in most other populations worldwide. Why this anomaly?
In our previous post, we suggested that some mutations linked to disease became very common in the Sakha as a result of exposure to extreme cold; Yakutia, where they live, has the lowest average winter temperatures worldwide.
It is not understood how GJB2 mutations cause deafness; several theories have been proposed. One of these is interesting from our perspective, one that centers around a tiny biomolecule called glutathione. It appears that the deafness mutations in GJB2 alter little channels between cells called connexins, connexin 26 to be precise, so as to have different flow characteristics. Glutathione is one of the molecules they let through, but these altered connexin 26 channels allow less of it through. The shortage of glutathione that results causes oxidative stress, which can damage the hair cells in the inner ear that are crucial for normal hearing. 

Interestingly, glutathione also plays a role in the physiological protection against cold, not in the ears specifically, but in several organs where GJB2 is expressed, notably the skin. It is an endogenous anti-oxidant - a compound that serves to mitigate the damage caused by oxidative stress when it occurs. One type of exposure known to cause harm to tissues through oxidative stress, is extreme cold. Glutathione is like an anti-freeze of the cell.  

This raises the possibility that the GJB2 mutation got to be so frequent in the Sakha because it offered a selective advantage to heterozyotes, helping them to deal better with extreme cold.

It might seem odd to propose that a mutation that seems to lower the amount of glutathione connexin channels allow to pass, should be advantageous when it is very cold. Yet, considering that the winter cold lasts for months on end, people move in and out of their homes, and are physiologically as well as, presumably, genetically adapted to these circumstances, it may well be that a 'normally' varying stress response is damaging in the long run, and you would want to regulate it down rather than up. It should not be difficult to verify how tissues of mutation carriers respond differently to extreme changes in temperature than others, in vivo and in vitro.

It has long been surmised that GJB2 mutations are so frequent because they conferred a selective advantage; protection from pathogens related to associated skin changes was offered as a possibility. Here, we advanced an alternative explanation, one that takes geography into account. If an environmental factor helped shape the geography of GJB2-linked deafness, then the place to start looking for answers is there where these mutations reach their peak. This, astonishingly, has not been done yet, although the high frequency in the Sakha has been suggested to be the result of a local selective advantage. Why not? Good question. Cold is an obvious first candidate for the responsible selective agent, and glutathione provides a link between cold exposure and connexin 26. It takes a synthesis of facts from quite different domains that is perhaps a specialty waiting to be developed.
            
A geographical question arises here: do these GJB2 mutations follow a distribution that reflects cold exposure more widely? Well, yes and no. Firstly, it is not only common in the Sakha, but in many other Siberian populations as well, although not quite as frequent as it is in them. Siberia, of course,, has a land climate with very cold winters. In most circumpolar populations, however, GJB2 mutations are not found at particular high frequencies. The presence of multiple different GJB2 mutations at high frequency in different Siberian populations does suggests a scenario though, that may solve this riddle. These mutations became so frequent in Siberia because they worked together with other genes present there to produce a cold-adapted phenotype; polygenic adaptation along those lines did not occur elsewhere. For this idea we saw some evidence in our previous post about 3-M syndrome. Here, we added some more, concerning a much more common hereditary disorder: deafness. 

As a final note: we associated the Yakutian GJB2 mutation not with cold exposure perse, but with the oxidative stress resulting from it. Other places on earth showing high GJB2 mutation frequencies may have a history of exposure to other factors causing oxidative stress. The totality of all internal and outward exposures of an orgamism is called the exposome. Rather than a so-called gene-environment interaction,  a gene-exposome interaction might be what explains the geography of these mutations. Furthermore, not all frequent GJB2 mutations need to have such an effect, they may either confer another kind of selective advantage, or none at all.

The causal question is actually even more complex, because, over the past millemia, many Siberian populations have migrated into Southwest Asia and Europe:  migration may explain the spread of these mutations to a certain extent as well.

But what about mutations linked to yet other hereditary diseases unusually common in the Sakha? This is the topic of our next post
