Here's an example of what we do.  Among the Sakha living in Yakutia, Siberia - the coldest region on our planet - several hereditary diseases are more common than elsewhere. One of these diseases is 3-M disease, also known as the Yakutian short stature syndrome, a name that speaks for itself. In  the Sakha patients it is invariably caused by one particular mutation in the CUL7 gene. All patients have inherited two copies, one from their father, one from their mother. People inheriting just one copy are unaffected, an inheritance pattern called autosomal recessive, or recessive for short.

For some recessive genetic diseases, it is known that unaffected carriers enjoy some fitness advantage. As a rule, this advantage is not universal, but dependent on certain environmental conditions. Many people originating from West Africa, for example, carry a mutation that helps them kill invading Tryponosoma parasites causing sleeping sickness. This mutation is much more frequent in parts of Africa where the parasite is - and has been for many centuries - a scourge. Carrying the mutation has a downside though: it predisposes to liver disease. The original spread of this mutation in parts of Africa was the result of Darwinian selection: its carriers were more likely to survive a trypanosomal infection, allowing them to reproduce and transmit the mutation to their offspring. Over the course of many generations this caused the mutation, and thereby unfortunately the liver disease as well, to become more common in them. Biologists say the mutation was 'selected for', in reference to Darwin's term ' natural selection', in spite of its link to disease. Paradoxically, diseases and adaptations can be two sides of the same coin. 

Since this mechanism may apply to other populations exposed to other types of dangerous environments, mutations linked to other genetic diseases could have spread in a similar fashion. They may have been selected for due to some unknown environmental factor. The nature of these factors we can discover by looking at the geographical distribution of such mutations. For the CUL7 mutation causing Yakutian short stature syndrome, this factor may well prove to be the extreme cold the Sakha were exposed to in winter. Yet, this particular hypothesis, like many similar ones, has, as far as we know, never been forwarded in the literature. Once we record it as a possibility, we can look for further evidence supporting it and try to understand its ramifications.

A study in evolutionary genetics, comparing the genomes of polar bears and brown bears, may well prove to be another piece in this puzzle. Among the twenty odd genes that show the genomic signature of having changed as a result of natural selection (a so-called 'selective sweep') in polar bears since they diverged from brown bears in the course of the last million years or so, CUL7 figures prominently. This is interesting, because, like the Yakutians when they invaded a previously uninhabited, inhospitable part of the world, the bears that came to be polar bears, were of course exposed to the same factor: extreme cold. While this is perhaps not yet conclusive evidence, we feel that the synthesis of these two facts tells a plausible story about the CUL7 gene and its relation to the environment. Yet, even if it is a true story, we do not know how the respective mutations in both polar bears and the Sakha carrying just one copy of it, protect them from these barren circumstances. It represents a novel question for science; for the large majority of genes the precise interaction with the various aspects of the environment is far from elucidated. The double ' natural experiment'  we just described may help to provide some answers.

An attentive reader might ask at this point: so why are the inuit and other peoples living near the poles not frequently affected by 3-M syndrome as well? This is of course a good point, a counterargument that may have kept researchers from exploring this scenario. But it doesnt quite kill the idea altogether. Genetic adaption to the environment is generally not a matter of one gene, but of many. When two populations adapt to the same environment, this need not involve exactly the same set of genes. Thus, quite possibly, in the Sakha CUL7 was part of the set of mutations allowing them to adapt to the cold, whereas in the inuit, it wasn't. This model, called polygenic adaptation, is still poorly understood because it is so complex.    

From this perspective, as a next step, it makes sense to take a look at other genetic diseases unusually prevalent in the Sakha. Perhaps the linked mutations could have had some advantage upon exposure to extreme cold as well.
